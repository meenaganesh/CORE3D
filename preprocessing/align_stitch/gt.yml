# This is the ground truth dataset for jacksonville
# In order to combine the vricon data into the proper tiles for comparison with the test data, the ground truth files
# were stitched and then tiled.  The output tiles are currently in EPSG:4326 (but this may change).
#
# In each of the supplied vricon raster data categories - change directory to the corresponding data folder
# (e.g. 170623-CORE3D-Performer-Data-Package/vricon_foundation_data/jacksonville/vricon_raster_50cm/classification/data)
# and build a large stitched image for the dataset.
#
# The commands to construct the single ground truth raster for classification would be:
#
#     gdalbuildvrt jacksonville_cls.vrt *.tif
#     gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 jacksonville_cls.vrt jacksonville_cls.tif
#
# This will produce a single image for the given AOI - which can be fed into the tiling routines, to create a parallel
# set of folders in the same directory structure that can be used for performance evaluation
