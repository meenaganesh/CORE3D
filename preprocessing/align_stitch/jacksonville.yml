# The registration image used for alignment - is well aligned to the OSM data. This image has been stitched
# and converted to grayscale for pan and msi alignment. It was manually constructed
#
# The jacksonville_rgb.tif is produced in the .cache/DIR of jacksonville_gt.yml configuration.
# Alternatively it can be produced by hand from the vricon dataset:
#     gdalbuildvrt *.tif jacksonville.vrt
#     gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 jacksonville.vrt jacksonville_rgb.tif
#
# The image is manually turned into grayscale:
# gdal_calc.py -A jacksonville_rgb.tif --A_band=1 -B jacksonville_rgb.tif --B_band=2 -C jacksonville_rgb.tif --C_band=3 --outfile=jacksonville_ref.tif --calc="A*0.2989+B*0.5870+C*0.1140"
