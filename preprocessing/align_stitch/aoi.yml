# Setting this will write the extent information for each of the added rasters, vectors and pointcloud data.
# The RasterModalityFilter will allow you select images meeting certain extent criteria.
# This file is appended to - so remove if you which to only contain data from this run.

# Each set of point cloud files will be merged into a single raster
# Each dataset appears in the sub-directory using the supplied name
# You can select dimensions to produce the data for.  Each dimension produces a separate raster.
# Each raster will have the bands specified by the specific statistics of interest (in the order specified).
point_clouds:

    statistics: "min,max,mean,idw,count,stdev"

 A raster mask will be created from the vector data - in the specified sub-directory using the supplied name
 for the raster file. The burn argument is the numerical value for the encountered shape.
vectors:
  - files: "/raid/data/wdixon/jacksonville/open_street_map/newSHP/ex_6Nv2MxW21gh8ifRtwCb75mo8YRTjb_osm_buildings.shp"
    dir: "SHP"

# calibrate: (boolean) indicating radiometric calibration is to be performed (default: True)
# dir: (str) sub-directory under output to place the files
# interpolation: (str) interpolation method used when rasterizing (default: "lanczos")
