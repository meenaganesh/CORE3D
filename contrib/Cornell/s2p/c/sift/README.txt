Wrapper to call SIFT on rectangular crops of large images.
by Carlo de Franchis, 18 March 2016


The code is made of two ingredients:
* the source code published with the IPOL paper "Anatomy of the SIFT Method" by
  Ives Rey Otero and Mauricio Delbracio. This code is contained in the folder
  sift_anatomy_20141201, with almost no changes with respect to the published
  version.
* the source code of fancy_image, a useful data structure for dealing with large
  images by Enric Meinhardt-Llopis.
