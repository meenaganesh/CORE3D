GITIQUETTE

(E1) To contribute, make a pull request to https://github.com/MISS3D/s2p

(E2) Make sure that your pull request passes all the tests before sending it.

(E3) Any pull request must be explicitly accepted by two persons before being
merged: a member of the CMLA team and a member of the CNES team.  These two
persons must be different to the author of the pull request.

(E4) Exception to (E3): typos and trivial bugfixes can be merged right away.

(E5) Optional: If the intent of the pull request is not clear, it may be
helpful to refer to the philosophy points (P1)--(P7) outlined below.

(E6) Admissible types of pull requests:
	* [bugfix] solves a concrete problem, changing one or at most two files
	* [feature] adds a new feature which is disabled by default
	* [config] changes the default configuration options
	* [refactor] moves files/functions around without changing the algorithm
	* [testing] changes the testing system, adds test data, etc.
	* [doc] documentation / comments
	* [trivial] typo or trivial bugfix on a single file

(E7) As far as possible, the types of pull requests in (E6) should be mutually exclusive.
For example, you cannot refactor and bugfix.


PHILOSOPHY

Since a perfect program is impossible, compromises are necessary.
We prefer to solve compromises according to the following order:

(P1) The program works.
(P2) The results are precise.
(P3) The program is fast.
(P4) The code is modular.
(P5) The code is the simplest possible.
(P6) The code has the least amount of dependences possible.
(P7) The code is portable.
